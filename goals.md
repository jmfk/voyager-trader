# VOYAGER-Trader Project Goals

*Inspired by the VOYAGER project: An Open-Ended Embodied Agent with Large Language Models*

## Primary Goal
Build an **autonomous, self-improving, profitable trading system** that develops trading knowledge through systematic exploration and experimentation. The system's core purpose is to **generate sustainable profits** while continuously learning and evolving. Profitability is defined as gains exceeding all operational costs (LLM usage, infrastructure, data, etc.). Following VOYAGER's paradigm of open-ended skill learning, the system will explore financial markets, acquire trading skills, and make discoveries while maintaining strict cost awareness and risk management.

## Core Objectives

### 1. Knowledge Discovery & Synthesis
- **Explore** market patterns, anomalies, and relationships across multiple asset classes
- **Generate** novel trading hypotheses through systematic analysis
- **Synthesize** learnings into reusable trading "skills" that can be combined and evolved
- **Build** a growing knowledge graph of market relationships and strategy effectiveness

### 2. Self-Evolving System Architecture
- **Continuously** discover and test new trading approaches without human intervention
- **Adapt** to changing market conditions through regime detection and strategy evolution
- **Learn** from both successes and failures to improve future strategy generation
- **Self-evolve** the system architecture, code quality, prompts, and agent configurations
- **Optimize** software routing, API selections, and infrastructure components automatically
- **Explore** system design improvements as part of the learning search space

### 3. Open-Ended Skill Development (Inspired by VOYAGER's Skill Library)
- **Develop** a library of modular, versioned trading skills that can be combined
- **Create** new skills through recombination and mutation of existing ones  
- **Maintain** skill versioning and deprecation based on performance and relevance
- **Enable** emergent complexity through skill composition
- **Store** skills as executable code with embeddings for semantic retrieval

### 4. Systematic Experimentation (Following VOYAGER's Iterative Improvement)
- **Implement** rigorous backtesting with realistic transaction costs and market impact
- **Conduct** walk-forward validation to ensure out-of-sample robustness
- **Test** strategies across different market regimes and conditions
- **Measure** exploration effectiveness, not just financial performance
- **Use** iterative feedback loops with environment response, execution errors, and self-verification

## Secondary Goals

### 5. Real-World Execution Capability
- **Support** two execution tiers: intraday (<500ms) and swing/position (<2s)
- **Incorporate** realistic market constraints (liquidity, slippage, transaction costs)
- **Manage** portfolio-level risk and position sizing
- **Interface** with live trading systems when strategies prove robust

### 6. Comprehensive Cost Management & Profitability
- **Track** all operational costs in real-time: LLM usage, API calls, infrastructure, data feeds
- **Implement** detailed telemetry for cost attribution across system components
- **Monitor** cost per trading decision, exploration attempt, and skill development
- **Optimize** LLM provider selection and usage patterns based on cost-effectiveness
- **Balance** exploration investment with expected profitability returns
- **Ensure** net positive returns after deducting all system operational costs
- **Measure** profit margins and cost efficiency as primary success metrics

### 7. Security-First Infrastructure
- **Ensure** data quality and eliminate survivorship bias
- **Maintain** system reliability and observability
- **Implement** built-in security monitoring to prevent LLM injection attacks
- **Monitor** for prompt manipulation and adversarial inputs
- **Secure** API endpoints and service interfaces
- **Operate** in locked-down, single-user environment on dedicated hardware
- **Support** distributed processing with security controls
- **Enable** continuous integration with security validation

### 8. Hallucination Prevention & Reliable Decision-Making
- **Maintain** a curated knowledge base of verified market information and trading facts
- **Implement** dual-system architecture: creative exploration system paired with critical judgment system
- **Balance** creative hypothesis generation with rigorous fact-checking and validation
- **Cross-reference** all trading decisions against verified knowledge base
- **Establish** confidence thresholds for decision-making based on information reliability
- **Track** and learn from instances where creative insights prove accurate vs. hallucinatory
- **Validate** all market assumptions and strategy components against historical data
- **Implement** systematic fact-checking before executing any trading actions

## Success Metrics

### Primary: Profitability & Cost Efficiency
- **Net Profit**: Total gains minus all operational costs (LLM, infrastructure, data, etc.)
- **Cost-Adjusted ROI**: Returns relative to total system investment
- **Operational Cost Tracking**: Detailed breakdown of LLM usage, API costs, infrastructure expenses
- **Cost per Strategy**: Development and testing costs for each trading strategy
- **Profit Margin Trends**: Sustainable profitability over time

### Learning & Exploration Metrics
- **Strategy Discovery Rate**: New profitable strategies discovered per month
- **Knowledge Graph Growth**: Expansion of market relationship understanding
- **Exploration ROI**: Learning value gained relative to exploration costs
- **System Evolution Rate**: Frequency of beneficial system architecture improvements

### System Performance Metrics
- **Adaptation Speed**: Time to adjust to new market regimes while maintaining profitability
- **Self-Evolution Effectiveness**: Improvements in system components over time
- **Security Incident Rate**: Detection and prevention of security threats
- **Skill Library Growth**: Number of profitable, reusable skills developed
- **Hallucination Detection Rate**: Identification and prevention of false or unverified claims
- **Knowledge Base Accuracy**: Verification rate of stored market information
- **Creative-Critical Balance**: Optimal ratio between exploration and validation systems

### Financial Performance
- **Risk-Adjusted Returns**: Sharpe ratio and maximum drawdown
- **Consistency**: Profitable performance across different market conditions
- **Cost Transparency**: Full accounting of all system expenses

## Anti-Goals (What We're NOT Building)

- ❌ A system with hardcoded trading strategies
- ❌ A traditional algorithmic trading platform with fixed rules
- ❌ A system optimized purely for short-term profits
- ❌ A black-box system without explainable learning mechanisms
- ❌ A system that requires constant human intervention for strategy development

## Key Principles (Adapted from VOYAGER's Architecture)

1. **Profitability First**: Every decision must contribute to sustainable net positive returns
2. **Cost-Aware Exploration**: Balance learning investment with expected profitability returns
3. **System Self-Evolution**: Continuously improve software architecture, prompts, and configurations
4. **Modularity**: Build composable components that can evolve independently
5. **Transparency**: Maintain explainable decision-making and cost attribution
6. **Security by Design**: Built-in monitoring and protection against threats and injections
7. **Automatic Curriculum**: System generates learning objectives based on profitability potential
8. **Iterative Refinement**: Use environment feedback to improve both strategies and system design
9. **Total Cost Accounting**: Track and optimize all operational expenses in real-time
