# ADR-0006: Logging and Monitoring Strategy

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The VOYAGER-Trader system operates autonomously in production environments, making comprehensive logging and monitoring critical for understanding system behavior, diagnosing issues, and tracking performance. The system needs observability across all components while maintaining security and performance requirements for real-time trading.

### Problem Statement

How do we provide comprehensive observability into the autonomous trading system's behavior while maintaining security, performance, and operational efficiency?

### Key Requirements

- Comprehensive logging across all system components (curriculum, skills, prompting, core)
- Real-time monitoring of trading performance and system health
- Security-aware logging that protects sensitive trading data and credentials
- Structured logging for automated analysis and alerting
- Performance monitoring with minimal impact on real-time trading
- Integration with observability platforms and alerting systems
- Audit trail for autonomous trading decisions and regulatory compliance

### Constraints

- Logging must not impact real-time trading performance
- Sensitive data (API keys, positions, balances) must be protected in logs
- Log volume must be manageable for long-running autonomous operation
- Must work in containerized and cloud environments
- Compliance with financial regulation logging requirements
- Cost-effective for continuous operation with large log volumes

## Decision

We will implement a structured logging approach using Loguru for Python logging with JSON formatting, OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing and metrics, and configurable log levels and filtering to balance observability needs with performance and security requirements.

### Chosen Approach

**Multi-Layer Observability Architecture**:

1. **Structured Logging Layer**:
   - Loguru for enhanced Python logging with JSON formatting
   - Standardized log structure across all components
   - Configurable log levels per component
   - Sensitive data filtering and masking
   - Correlation IDs for tracking autonomous learning loops

2. **Metrics and Performance Monitoring**:
   - OpenTelemetry for metrics collection and tracing
   - Custom trading metrics (PnL, success rates, skill usage)
   - System performance metrics (latency, memory, CPU)
   - Component interaction tracing

3. **Health Monitoring and Alerting**:
   - Health check endpoints for all critical components
   - Automated alerting for system failures and performance degradation
   - Watchdog monitoring for autonomous operation status

4. **Audit and Compliance Logging**:
   - Decision audit trail for trading actions
   - Skill learning and curriculum progression logs
   - Regulatory compliance logging for trading activities

### Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Standard Python Logging Only**
   - Description: Use built-in logging module with basic formatters
   - Pros: No external dependencies, simple setup, familiar
   - Cons: Limited structured logging, poor JSON support, basic filtering
   - Why rejected: Insufficient for autonomous system observability needs

2. **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**
   - Description: Full ELK stack for log aggregation and analysis
   - Pros: Powerful search and visualization, industry standard
   - Cons: Heavy infrastructure, complex setup, high resource usage
   - Why rejected: Too complex for current scope, can be added later

3. **Prometheus + Grafana Only**
   - Description: Focus on metrics and monitoring without detailed logging
   - Pros: Excellent metrics and dashboards, lightweight
   - Cons: Limited log analysis, harder to debug autonomous behavior
   - Why rejected: Need detailed logs for understanding learning behavior

## Consequences

The chosen observability approach will provide comprehensive insights into system behavior while introducing some complexity in setup and configuration.

### Positive Consequences

- Comprehensive visibility into autonomous trading system behavior
- Structured logs enable automated analysis and alerting
- OpenTelemetry provides industry-standard observability
- Security-aware logging protects sensitive trading data
- Performance monitoring helps optimize real-time trading
- Audit trails support regulatory compliance
- Correlation IDs enable tracing of autonomous learning processes

### Negative Consequences

- Additional complexity in logging configuration
- Performance overhead from structured logging and tracing
- Storage costs for comprehensive log data
- Learning curve for OpenTelemetry tooling

### Neutral Consequences

- Observability becomes part of development workflow
- Log analysis tools become essential for system understanding
- Monitoring setup required for all deployment environments

## Implementation

### Implementation Steps

1. Implement structured logging with Loguru and JSON formatting
2. Add sensitive data filtering and correlation ID generation
3. Integrate OpenTelemetry for metrics and distributed tracing
4. Create custom trading metrics and performance monitors
5. Add health check endpoints to all components
6. Configure log levels and filtering per component
7. Create monitoring dashboards and alerting rules
8. Add audit logging for trading decisions and learning events

### Success Criteria

- All components produce structured logs with consistent formatting
- Performance impact of logging is less than 5% of execution time
- Sensitive data is properly masked in all log outputs
- Monitoring dashboards show real-time system health
- Alerts trigger within 60 seconds of system issues
- Complete audit trail available for all trading decisions
- Correlation IDs enable end-to-end tracing of autonomous processes

### Timeline

- Structured logging setup: 3 days
- OpenTelemetry integration: 4 days
- Custom metrics and health checks: 3 days
- Sensitive data filtering: 2 days
- Monitoring dashboards: 3 days
- Total: ~2-3 weeks

## Notes

This observability strategy is critical for the autonomous nature of the trading system. Unlike traditional applications, we cannot rely on human operators to notice and respond to issues - the system must be self-monitoring with automated alerting.

Key considerations for autonomous trading observability:
- Learning loop progression must be observable and measurable
- Skill acquisition and performance should be tracked over time
- Market condition impact on system behavior needs monitoring
- Resource usage patterns help optimize for long-running operation

Security is paramount - trading positions, balances, and API credentials must never appear in logs. We'll use configurable sensitive data patterns and automatic masking.

The structured logging approach enables machine learning on log data to identify patterns in autonomous behavior and potential improvements to the learning algorithms.

Future enhancements may include:
- ML-based anomaly detection on log patterns
- Automated log analysis for trading strategy optimization
- Integration with external observability platforms (DataDog, New Relic)
