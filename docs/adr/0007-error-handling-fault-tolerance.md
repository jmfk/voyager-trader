# ADR-0007: Error Handling and Fault Tolerance Patterns

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The VOYAGER-Trader system must operate autonomously with high reliability in volatile market conditions. The system faces various failure modes including network issues, API rate limits, market data provider outages, broker connectivity problems, and AI model service interruptions. Autonomous operation means the system must handle these failures gracefully without human intervention while protecting capital and maintaining learning progress.

### Problem Statement

How do we build resilient error handling and fault tolerance into the autonomous trading system to ensure continuous operation, capital protection, and learning progress preservation despite various system and external service failures?

### Key Requirements

- Graceful degradation when external services fail (market data, brokers, AI models)
- Capital protection through risk management during system failures
- Recovery strategies for different types of failures (transient vs permanent)
- Preservation of learning progress and skill library during failures
- Circuit breaker patterns for external service integration
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Autonomous operation continuation with reduced functionality when needed

### Constraints

- Cannot rely on human intervention during autonomous operation
- Must protect capital and avoid catastrophic losses during failures
- Performance impact of error handling must be minimal for real-time trading
- Recovery mechanisms must not interfere with normal operation
- Error handling complexity should not obscure business logic
- Must maintain audit trail of failures for regulatory compliance

## Decision

We will implement a layered fault tolerance approach with circuit breakers, retry patterns, graceful degradation, and autonomous recovery strategies that prioritize capital protection and system continuity over optimal performance.

### Chosen Approach

**Multi-Level Fault Tolerance Architecture**:

1. **Circuit Breaker Layer**:
   - Circuit breakers for all external service integrations
   - Configurable failure thresholds and recovery timeouts
   - Automatic fallback to backup providers where available
   - Health monitoring and automatic circuit recovery

2. **Retry and Backoff Layer**:
   - Exponential backoff with jitter for transient failures
   - Different retry strategies for different failure types
   - Maximum retry limits to prevent infinite loops
   - Dead letter queues for persistent failures

3. **Graceful Degradation Layer**:
   - Fallback modes for reduced functionality operation
   - Priority-based service degradation (protect core functions)
   - Autonomous mode switching based on available services
   - Safe shutdown procedures when critical services unavailable

4. **Recovery and Persistence Layer**:
   - State persistence for recovery after system restart
   - Skill library backup and recovery mechanisms
   - Learning progress checkpointing
   - Transaction rollback for failed trading operations

### Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Simple Try-Catch Error Handling**
   - Description: Basic exception handling with logging
   - Pros: Simple to implement and understand
   - Cons: No fault tolerance, no recovery, system fails on errors
   - Why rejected: Insufficient for autonomous operation requirements

2. **Supervision Tree (Erlang/Actor Model)**
   - Description: Hierarchical supervisor processes that restart failed components
   - Pros: Excellent fault isolation, proven in telecom systems
   - Cons: Complex in Python, requires significant architectural changes
   - Why rejected: Too complex for current Python-based architecture

3. **Microservices with Service Mesh**
   - Description: Service mesh handles fault tolerance at infrastructure level
   - Pros: Infrastructure-level fault tolerance, battle-tested patterns
   - Cons: Over-engineering for single-process autonomous system
   - Why rejected: Adds unnecessary complexity for current scope

## Consequences

The layered fault tolerance approach will provide robust error handling capabilities while adding complexity to component design and testing.

### Positive Consequences

- System continues autonomous operation despite external service failures
- Capital protection through safe failure modes and position management
- Learning progress preserved across system restarts and failures
- Reduced manual intervention requirements for common failure scenarios
- Predictable system behavior under failure conditions
- Regulatory compliance through proper error logging and audit trails
- Improved system reliability and uptime

### Negative Consequences

- Increased complexity in component design and implementation
- Additional testing requirements for failure scenarios
- Performance overhead from error handling mechanisms
- More complex debugging when error handling masks root causes

### Neutral Consequences

- Error handling becomes integral part of component design
- Testing strategy must include failure scenario coverage
- Operations procedures need to account for autonomous recovery capabilities

## Implementation

### Implementation Steps

1. Define error handling interfaces and exception hierarchy
2. Implement circuit breaker pattern for external services
3. Add retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
4. Create graceful degradation strategies for each component
5. Implement state persistence and recovery mechanisms
6. Add comprehensive error logging and monitoring
7. Create failure scenario tests and chaos engineering tests
8. Document recovery procedures and manual override capabilities

### Success Criteria

- System continues trading during temporary external service outages
- No capital loss occurs due to unhandled system failures
- Circuit breakers trigger and recover automatically
- Learning progress is preserved across system restarts
- Failed operations are properly logged with recovery actions taken
- System uptime exceeds 99.5% excluding planned maintenance
- Failure scenario tests pass consistently

### Timeline

- Error handling framework: 4 days
- Circuit breaker implementation: 3 days
- Retry and backoff mechanisms: 2 days
- Graceful degradation patterns: 4 days
- State persistence and recovery: 3 days
- Testing and validation: 4 days
- Total: ~3 weeks

## Notes

Error handling and fault tolerance are especially critical for autonomous trading systems because:

1. **Capital at Risk**: Unhandled failures can lead to financial losses
2. **No Human Operator**: System must self-recover without intervention
3. **Market Volatility**: Failures often occur during high-stress market conditions
4. **Learning Continuity**: Progress must be preserved to maintain autonomous improvement

Key patterns we'll implement:
- **Bulkhead Pattern**: Isolate failures to prevent cascade effects
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascading failures from external services
- **Timeout Pattern**: Prevent resource exhaustion from slow services
- **Retry Pattern**: Handle transient failures with intelligent backoff
- **Fallback Pattern**: Provide alternative functionality when services fail

Special considerations for trading systems:
- **Position Safety**: Never allow positions to remain unmanaged due to failures
- **Order State**: Track order states across failures and recoveries
- **Market Data**: Handle gaps and inconsistencies in market data feeds
- **Risk Limits**: Maintain risk controls even during degraded operation

The fault tolerance system will be designed with defense in depth:
1. **Prevention**: Validate inputs and check preconditions
2. **Detection**: Monitor for failures and anomalies
3. **Recovery**: Implement recovery strategies for different failure types
4. **Learning**: Adapt strategies based on failure patterns

This aligns with the VOYAGER learning approach - the system should learn from failures and improve its fault tolerance over time.
