# ADR-0001: Record Architecture Decisions

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The VOYAGER-Trader project is an autonomous, self-improving trading system with complex architectural requirements. As the system evolves, we need to document significant architectural decisions to:

### Problem Statement

- Maintain historical context for architectural choices
- Enable new team members to understand design rationale
- Facilitate informed decision-making when modifying existing architecture
- Ensure consistency across the codebase
- Support system evolution while maintaining design coherence

### Key Requirements

- Document all significant architectural decisions
- Provide clear context and rationale for decisions
- Enable traceability between decisions and implementations
- Support decision evolution and supersession
- Integrate with development workflow

### Constraints

- Must not slow down development process
- Should be lightweight and maintainable
- Must integrate with GitHub workflow
- Should be accessible to both humans and automated tools

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document all significant architectural decisions for the VOYAGER-Trader project.

### Chosen Approach

1. **ADR Format**: Use Michael Nygard's ADR template with enhancements for migration paths
2. **Storage**: Store ADRs in `docs/adr/` directory in the main repository
3. **Naming**: Use sequential numbering (0001, 0002, etc.) with descriptive titles
4. **Lifecycle**: Support Proposed ‚Üí Accepted ‚Üí [Superseded/Deprecated] states
5. **Integration**: Enforce ADR compliance through GitHub PR workflows
6. **Migration**: Require detailed migration paths when superseding ADRs

### Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Wiki-based Documentation**
   - Description: Use GitHub wiki or external wiki
   - Pros: Easy to edit, good for collaborative editing
   - Cons: Not version controlled with code, harder to enforce consistency
   - Why rejected: Lack of version control integration

2. **Inline Code Comments**
   - Description: Document architectural decisions as code comments
   - Pros: Close to implementation, always up-to-date
   - Cons: Scattered information, hard to get overview, limited context
   - Why rejected: Poor discoverability and context

3. **External Documentation System**
   - Description: Use Confluence, Notion, or similar
   - Pros: Rich formatting, good collaboration features
   - Cons: Separate from codebase, access control issues, potential vendor lock-in
   - Why rejected: Separation from development workflow

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- Clear historical record of architectural decisions
- Better onboarding for new developers
- Improved architectural consistency across the project
- Explicit consideration of alternatives before making decisions
- Integration with development workflow ensures ADRs stay current
- Migration paths enable smooth architectural evolution

### Negative Consequences

- Additional overhead for documenting decisions
- Requires discipline to maintain ADRs
- May slow down initial decision-making process
- Risk of ADRs becoming stale if not maintained

### Neutral Consequences

- ADR directory will grow over time
- Need to educate team on ADR process
- Requires tooling integration for enforcement

## Implementation

### Implementation Steps

1. ‚úÖ Create ADR directory structure (`docs/adr/`)
2. ‚úÖ Create ADR template and README
3. ‚úÖ Set up GitHub workflow for ADR validation
4. ‚úÖ Create this meta-ADR about using ADRs
5. üîÑ Update Claude Code instructions to enforce ADR usage
6. ‚è≥ Train team on ADR process
7. ‚è≥ Create initial ADRs for existing architectural decisions

### Success Criteria

- All significant architectural decisions documented as ADRs
- ADRs referenced in code and PR reviews
- New team members can understand system architecture through ADRs
- ADR compliance enforced through automated checks
- Migration paths successfully guide system evolution

### Timeline

- Initial setup: Immediate (January 2025)
- Team training: Within 1 week
- Backfill existing decisions: Within 2 weeks
- Full process adoption: Within 1 month

## Notes

This ADR establishes the foundation for all future architectural documentation. It should be reviewed and potentially updated as the project grows and the team learns from using ADRs.

The process should be lightweight enough to encourage usage while rigorous enough to provide value. We will evaluate the effectiveness of this approach after 3 months and adjust as needed.
