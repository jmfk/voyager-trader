# ADR-0012: VOYAGER Skill Library Architecture

## Status

Proposed

## Context

VOYAGER-Trader requires a comprehensive skill library system to store, manage, and compose trading skills discovered through autonomous learning. This is one of VOYAGER's three key components alongside the automatic curriculum and iterative prompting mechanism.

### Problem Statement

The system needs to automatically discover, validate, store, and reuse trading skills in a way that enables continuous learning and improvement. Skills must be safely executable, composable, and trackable for performance over time.

### Key Requirements

- Safe skill execution environment with isolation
- Skill composition and combination mechanisms  
- Comprehensive performance tracking and validation
- Dependency management between skills
- Automated skill discovery from successful strategies
- Persistent storage with efficient retrieval
- Version control and skill evolution tracking
- Integration with existing data models and curriculum system

### Constraints

- Must integrate with existing Pydantic-based model architecture
- Must support Python code execution with security considerations
- Must work with existing performance tracking infrastructure
- Must be extensible for different skill types and complexity levels
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing skill data

## Decision

We will implement a modular skill library architecture with six core components that work together to provide comprehensive skill management capabilities.

### Chosen Approach

**Core Architecture Components:**

1. **Skill Definition System** - Enhanced Pydantic models with comprehensive metadata
2. **Skill Executor** - Safe execution environment with sandboxing and timeout protection
3. **Skill Composer** - Advanced composition engine supporting dependency resolution
4. **Skill Validator** - Multi-faceted validation including syntax, logic, and performance testing
5. **Skill Librarian** - Storage and retrieval system with indexing and search capabilities
6. **Skill Discoverer** - Pattern recognition and extraction from successful trading strategies

**Key Design Patterns:**

- **Repository Pattern** for skill storage abstraction
- **Strategy Pattern** for different validation approaches
- **Composite Pattern** for skill composition
- **Observer Pattern** for performance tracking
- **Factory Pattern** for skill creation and discovery

**Data Flow Architecture:**

```
Trading Experience → Skill Discoverer → Skill Definition → Skill Validator → Skill Librarian
                                                      ↓
Skill Executor ← Skill Composer ← Performance Tracker
```

### Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Simple File-Based Storage**
   - Description: Store skills as individual Python files with JSON metadata
   - Pros: Simple implementation, human-readable, version control friendly
   - Cons: Limited query capabilities, no transactional consistency, difficult skill composition
   - Why rejected: Insufficient for complex skill relationships and performance tracking

2. **Database-Centric Approach**
   - Description: Store all skill data and code in relational database
   - Pros: Strong consistency, complex queries, transactional safety
   - Cons: Code storage in database is suboptimal, difficult version control, complex migrations
   - Why rejected: Doesn't align with existing file-based model storage patterns

3. **External Skill Registry**
   - Description: Use external service or package registry for skill management
   - Pros: Centralized management, built-in versioning, distribution capabilities
   - Cons: External dependency, network latency, complexity for local development
   - Why rejected: Adds unnecessary complexity for single-agent system

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- Systematic skill accumulation and reuse enabling continuous learning
- Safe execution environment prevents malicious or erroneous code from causing system damage
- Composable skills allow building complex strategies from simple components
- Comprehensive tracking enables data-driven skill improvement and selection
- Modular architecture enables independent testing and development of components
- Integration with existing models maintains consistency with current architecture

### Negative Consequences

- Increased system complexity requiring careful testing and validation
- Performance overhead from sandboxing and validation processes
- Storage requirements grow with skill library size
- Additional maintenance burden for six distinct components
- Potential security risks from dynamic code execution despite sandboxing

### Neutral Consequences

- Changes to existing skill data structures require migration scripts
- Development team needs to understand all six components for effective maintenance
- Skill library becomes a critical system component requiring backup and recovery planning

## Implementation

### Implementation Steps

1. Extend existing Skill model in learning.py with enhanced metadata and validation
2. Implement SkillExecutor with Python subprocess sandboxing and security controls
3. Build SkillComposer with dependency resolution and conflict detection
4. Create SkillValidator with multiple validation strategies (syntax, performance, logic)
5. Develop SkillLibrarian with efficient storage, indexing, and search capabilities
6. Implement SkillDiscoverer with pattern recognition for successful strategy analysis
7. Integrate all components with existing curriculum and performance tracking systems
8. Create comprehensive test suite with mock trading environments
9. Add monitoring and logging for all skill operations

### Success Criteria

- Skills can be safely executed in isolation without system impact
- Complex skills can be composed from simpler prerequisite skills
- Skill performance is accurately tracked and reported over time
- Failed or low-performing skills are automatically identified and archived
- Skills can be discovered from successful trading strategies automatically
- System maintains >99% uptime during skill operations
- Skill library can scale to 1000+ skills without performance degradation

### Timeline

- Phase 1 (Week 1-2): Core models and executor implementation
- Phase 2 (Week 3): Composer and validator implementation  
- Phase 3 (Week 4): Librarian and discoverer implementation
- Phase 4 (Week 5): Integration testing and performance optimization
- Phase 5 (Week 6): Production deployment and monitoring setup

## Notes

This ADR builds upon the existing Skill model in learning.py and extends it with the six-component architecture. The implementation will maintain backward compatibility with existing skill data while adding the new capabilities required for autonomous skill discovery and management.

The security implications of dynamic code execution require careful consideration and implementation of multiple layers of protection including process isolation, resource limits, and code analysis.
