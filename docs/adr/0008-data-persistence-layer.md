# ADR-0008: Data Persistence Layer Design

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The VOYAGER-Trader system requires persistent storage for multiple types of data: learned skills, historical market data, trading performance metrics, system configuration, and audit trails. The autonomous nature requires reliable data persistence that supports concurrent access, efficient querying, and backup/recovery. Different data types have different consistency, performance, and storage requirements.

### Problem Statement

How do we design a data persistence layer that efficiently handles diverse data types (skills, market data, metrics, configuration) while supporting autonomous operation, high performance querying, and reliable backup/recovery?

### Key Requirements

- Persistent storage for trading skills with versioning and metadata
- High-performance storage for market data (OHLCV, tick data, order book)
- Metrics and performance data storage with time-series capabilities
- Configuration and system state persistence
- Audit trail storage for regulatory compliance
- Concurrent read/write access for autonomous operation
- Efficient querying for skill discovery and market data analysis
- Backup and recovery mechanisms for data protection

### Constraints

- Performance requirements for real-time trading (low latency reads)
- Storage efficiency for large market data volumes
- Data consistency requirements for trading operations
- Backup and recovery capabilities for business continuity
- Cost considerations for large-scale data storage
- Integration with existing Python ecosystem and tools

## Decision

We will implement a polyglot persistence approach using SQLite for structured data and skills storage, InfluxDB for time-series market data and metrics, and file-based storage for large artifacts, with a unified data access layer providing consistent interfaces across storage types.

### Chosen Approach

**Polyglot Persistence Architecture**:

1. **Structured Data Layer (SQLite)**:
   - Trading skills with metadata, versioning, and performance tracking
   - System configuration and user preferences
   - Audit logs and compliance data
   - Relational data requiring ACID properties
   - Full-text search capabilities for skill discovery

2. **Time-Series Data Layer (InfluxDB)**:
   - Market data (OHLCV, tick data, order book snapshots)
   - Performance metrics and system monitoring data
   - Trading signals and strategy outputs
   - High-throughput ingestion and efficient time-based queries

3. **File Storage Layer**:
   - Large model artifacts and serialized objects
   - Historical data archives and backups
   - Configuration files and templates
   - Log files and debugging artifacts

4. **Unified Data Access Layer**:
   - Repository pattern with consistent interfaces
   - Connection pooling and transaction management
   - Query optimization and caching
   - Migration and schema management

### Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Single PostgreSQL Database**
   - Description: Use PostgreSQL for all data storage needs with extensions
   - Pros: ACID compliance, mature ecosystem, full SQL support, JSON support
   - Cons: Not optimized for time-series data, higher resource usage, setup complexity
   - Why rejected: Over-engineered for current scope, time-series performance concerns

2. **NoSQL-Only Approach (MongoDB)**
   - Description: Use MongoDB for flexible schema and document storage
   - Pros: Flexible schema, good for varied data types, horizontal scaling
   - Cons: Eventual consistency, no ACID guarantees, poor time-series performance
   - Why rejected: Trading requires strong consistency, time-series capabilities needed

3. **Pure File-Based Storage**
   - Description: Use JSON/CSV files with custom indexing
   - Pros: Simple, no database dependencies, easy backup
   - Cons: Poor concurrent access, no query optimization, scalability issues
   - Why rejected: Insufficient for autonomous operation with concurrent access needs

## Consequences

The polyglot persistence approach will provide optimal performance for different data types while introducing complexity in data access layer management.

### Positive Consequences

- Optimal performance for each data type (relational, time-series, files)
- SQLite provides ACID guarantees for critical trading data
- InfluxDB excels at time-series market data ingestion and querying
- Lower resource usage compared to heavy database systems
- Simpler deployment and maintenance
- Good backup and recovery capabilities
- Unified interface abstracts storage complexity from business logic

### Negative Consequences

- Complexity in managing multiple storage systems
- Data access layer requires more sophisticated implementation
- Cross-storage transactions are more complex
- Multiple backup strategies needed for different storage types

### Neutral Consequences

- Data modeling becomes storage-type specific
- Development team needs familiarity with multiple storage technologies
- Testing requires setup of multiple storage systems

## Implementation

### Implementation Steps

1. Design and implement unified data access interfaces
2. Set up SQLite database with skills and configuration schemas
3. Implement InfluxDB integration for time-series data
4. Create file storage abstraction layer
5. Implement repository pattern for each data type
6. Add connection pooling and transaction management
7. Create migration and schema management tools
8. Implement comprehensive backup and recovery procedures

### Success Criteria

- All data types can be stored and retrieved efficiently
- Market data ingestion keeps up with real-time feeds
- Skill queries respond within 100ms for autonomous operation
- Concurrent access works correctly without data corruption
- Backup and recovery procedures complete successfully
- Storage usage grows predictably with system usage
- Data integrity checks pass consistently

### Timeline

- Data access layer design: 3 days
- SQLite implementation: 4 days
- InfluxDB integration: 4 days
- File storage layer: 2 days
- Repository implementations: 4 days
- Backup and recovery: 3 days
- Total: ~3 weeks

## Notes

The choice of polyglot persistence aligns well with the autonomous trading domain requirements:

**SQLite Benefits for Trading Systems**:
- ACID compliance ensures data consistency for critical trading operations
- Embedded database reduces deployment complexity
- Excellent performance for read-heavy workloads (skill discovery)
- Full-text search supports natural language skill queries
- Zero-configuration and maintenance-free operation

**InfluxDB Benefits for Market Data**:
- Purpose-built for time-series data with automatic retention policies
- Efficient compression for large market data volumes
- Built-in downsampling and aggregation functions
- High-throughput ingestion handles real-time market feeds
- SQL-like query language familiar to developers

**Storage Layout Strategy**:
- **Skills Database**: Version history, performance metrics, dependencies
- **Market Data**: Separate measurement per symbol/timeframe
- **System Metrics**: Separate measurement per component
- **Files**: Organized by date and type for efficient archival

The unified data access layer will provide:
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean abstraction over different storage types
- **Connection Management**: Efficient pooling and lifecycle management
- **Query Building**: Type-safe query construction
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching for frequently accessed data
- **Migrations**: Schema evolution support

**Backup Strategy**:
- SQLite: File-based backup with WAL mode for consistency
- InfluxDB: Built-in backup/restore utilities
- Files: Standard file system backup with deduplication

Future considerations:
- May need to migrate to PostgreSQL if concurrent access requirements grow
- Could add Redis for high-frequency caching layer
- Time-series data retention policies to manage storage costs
- Read replicas for analytical workloads if needed
