# ADR-0005: Configuration Management Approach

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The VOYAGER-Trader system operates autonomously in multiple environments (development, testing, production) with varying requirements for market data providers, broker connections, risk parameters, and AI model configurations. We need a robust configuration management approach that supports environment-specific settings while maintaining security and operational flexibility.

### Problem Statement

How do we manage configuration across different environments and deployment scenarios while maintaining security, flexibility, and autonomous operation capabilities for the trading system?

### Key Requirements

- Support multiple environments (dev, test, staging, production) with different configurations
- Secure management of sensitive credentials (API keys, broker tokens, database passwords)
- Runtime configuration updates for autonomous adaptation
- Environment-specific feature flags and component selection
- Configuration validation and error handling
- Support for different market data providers and broker configurations
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines and containerized deployments

### Constraints

- Must not expose sensitive credentials in version control
- Configuration must be loadable without external dependencies during system startup
- Performance requirements - configuration loading must be fast for real-time trading
- Must work in containerized environments (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Python ecosystem constraints for configuration libraries
- Autonomous operation requires runtime configuration adaptation

## Decision

We will implement a layered configuration approach using Pydantic for validation, environment variables for sensitive data, and YAML files for structured configuration, with support for environment-specific overrides and runtime updates.

### Chosen Approach

**Layered Configuration Architecture**:

1. **Base Configuration Layer**: YAML files with default settings and structure
   - `config/base.yaml` - Default configuration values
   - `config/environments/` - Environment-specific overrides
   - Clear schema and documentation for all settings

2. **Environment Variables Layer**: Sensitive and environment-specific values
   - API keys, database passwords, broker credentials
   - Environment selection (`TRADING_ENV=production`)
   - Override capabilities for any configuration value

3. **Runtime Configuration Layer**: Dynamic updates during autonomous operation
   - Risk parameter adjustments based on market conditions
   - Provider failover configuration
   - Performance tuning parameters

4. **Validation Layer**: Pydantic models for type safety and validation
   - Strong typing for all configuration values
   - Custom validators for trading-specific constraints
   - Automatic environment variable binding
   - Configuration schema documentation

### Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Pure Environment Variables**
   - Description: Use only environment variables for all configuration
   - Pros: Simple, secure, container-friendly, no file dependencies
   - Cons: Hard to manage complex nested configurations, poor developer experience
   - Why rejected: Trading configurations are too complex for flat key-value pairs

2. **JSON Configuration Files**
   - Description: Use JSON files with environment variable substitution
   - Pros: Structured data, widely supported, simple parsing
   - Cons: No comments, limited data types, verbose for complex configs
   - Why rejected: YAML provides better readability and developer experience

3. **Python Configuration Files**
   - Description: Use Python modules as configuration (Django-style)
   - Pros: Full Python power, dynamic configuration, easy imports
   - Cons: Security risks, harder to validate, can't be parsed by non-Python tools
   - Why rejected: Security concerns and difficulty with external tooling

## Consequences

The layered configuration approach will provide flexibility and security while adding some complexity to the initial setup and maintenance.

### Positive Consequences

- Strong typing and validation prevents runtime configuration errors
- Secure credential management through environment variables
- Clear separation between public configuration (YAML) and secrets
- Easy environment-specific customization
- Runtime configuration updates support autonomous adaptation
- Good developer experience with readable YAML files
- Integration-friendly with CI/CD and container orchestration

### Negative Consequences

- Additional complexity in configuration loading logic
- Multiple configuration sources to maintain and document
- Potential for configuration conflicts between layers
- Initial setup complexity for new environments

### Neutral Consequences

- Configuration becomes more explicit and documented
- Environment setup requires both YAML and environment variable management
- Testing requires configuration setup for different scenarios

## Implementation

### Implementation Steps

1. Create Pydantic configuration models with full type hints and validation
2. Implement configuration loading logic with layer precedence
3. Create base YAML configuration files and environment-specific overrides
4. Update TradingConfig to use new configuration system
5. Add configuration validation and error reporting
6. Create configuration templates and documentation
7. Update all components to use new configuration approach
8. Add configuration hot-reloading capability for runtime updates

### Success Criteria

- All environments can be configured without code changes
- No secrets are exposed in version control or logs
- Configuration validation catches errors before system startup
- Runtime configuration updates work without system restart
- New environments can be created easily with configuration templates
- All configuration values are properly typed and documented

### Timeline

- Pydantic models: 2 days
- Configuration loading: 3 days
- YAML structure and templates: 2 days
- Component integration: 3 days
- Testing and documentation: 2 days
- Total: ~2 weeks

## Notes

This configuration approach supports the autonomous nature of the trading system by allowing runtime parameter adjustments while maintaining security and reliability. The layered approach provides flexibility without sacrificing safety.

The use of Pydantic aligns with modern Python practices and provides excellent integration with FastAPI if we later add web interfaces. The YAML + environment variable combination is widely supported in cloud-native deployments.

Special considerations for autonomous trading:
- Risk parameters may need runtime adjustment based on market conditions
- Provider failover requires configuration updates without restart
- Performance tuning may require A/B testing different parameter sets

Configuration security is critical - credentials for broker APIs and data providers must never be logged or exposed.
