# ADR-0004: Testing Framework Selection

## Status

Accepted

## Context

VOYAGER-Trader requires comprehensive testing for financial applications including unit, integration, and async testing.

### Problem Statement

We need testing frameworks that support financial application testing requirements.

### Key Requirements

- Modern pytest-style testing
- Asynchronous testing capabilities
- Code coverage reporting
- Financial data testing utilities

## Decision

We will use pytest as the primary testing framework with supporting plugins.

### Chosen Approach

- **pytest**: Primary testing framework
- **pytest-cov**: Code coverage reporting
- **pytest-asyncio**: Asynchronous testing
- **Coverage.py**: Coverage analysis

### Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **unittest**: Less powerful, more verbose
2. **nose2**: Smaller community than pytest
3. **Robot Framework**: Overkill for unit testing

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- Modern Python testing standard
- Powerful fixture system for financial scenarios
- Excellent async testing support
- Comprehensive coverage reporting

### Negative Consequences

- Additional dependencies vs stdlib unittest
- Learning curve for pytest idioms
