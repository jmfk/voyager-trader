# ADR-0017: Trading Strategy Execution Engine Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to implement a robust trading strategy execution engine that can safely execute AI-generated trading strategies while providing comprehensive risk management, order lifecycle management, and performance tracking. The engine must support both paper trading and live execution modes.

## Decision
We will implement a multi-component execution engine with the following architecture:

### Core Components
1. **StrategyExecutor**: Main orchestrator that runs strategies safely
2. **OrderManager**: Handles order lifecycle and execution
3. **PortfolioManager**: Manages positions and portfolio state
4. **RiskManager**: Enforces risk limits and position sizing
5. **ExecutionMonitor**: Tracks execution quality and performance
6. **BrokerageInterface**: Abstracts brokerage API interactions

### Key Design Principles
- **Event-driven architecture** for real-time processing
- **Thread-safe state management** for concurrent execution
- **Strategy isolation** to prevent strategy failures from affecting others
- **Comprehensive risk controls** with circuit breakers
- **Unified interface** for paper and live trading
- **Audit trail** for all trading actions

### Execution Flow
1. Strategy generates trading signals
2. RiskManager validates against limits
3. OrderManager creates and submits orders
4. PortfolioManager updates positions
5. ExecutionMonitor tracks performance
6. All actions logged for audit

### Risk Management Features
- Position size limits (per symbol, portfolio-wide)
- Daily loss limits with auto-shutdown
- Drawdown protection
- Correlation limits across positions
- Leverage constraints
- Strategy performance monitoring

## Consequences

### Positive
- Safe execution of AI-generated strategies
- Comprehensive risk management
- Unified paper/live trading interface
- Detailed performance tracking
- Scalable architecture for multiple strategies

### Negative
- Complex architecture requiring careful coordination
- Performance overhead from risk checks
- Additional testing complexity
- More moving parts to maintain

## Implementation Notes
- Use existing trading models from `models.trading`
- Integrate with centralized LLM service for strategy generation
- Support multiple brokerage APIs through adapter pattern
- Comprehensive test coverage with both unit and integration tests
