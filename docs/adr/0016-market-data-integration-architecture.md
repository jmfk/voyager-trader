# ADR-0016: Market Data Integration Architecture

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The VOYAGER-Trader system requires comprehensive market data integration to support real-time trading decisions and historical backtesting. The system must handle multiple data sources with different APIs, rate limits, and data formats while maintaining high performance and reliability.

### Problem Statement

We need a robust market data integration system that can:
- Fetch real-time and historical market data from multiple providers
- Handle API failures and rate limiting gracefully  
- Normalize data from different sources into consistent formats
- Cache and store data efficiently for fast access
- Support both streaming and batch data operations

### Key Requirements

- Real-time market data streaming with low latency (<100ms)
- Historical data backfilling capabilities
- Multiple data source support (Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, IEX Cloud, Polygon.io)
- Data validation and quality assurance
- Rate limiting and API quota management
- Async operations for high performance
- Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- Mock data generation for testing environments

### Constraints

- API rate limits vary by provider (5-1000 requests/minute)
- Cost considerations for premium data feeds
- Memory efficiency for high-frequency tick data
- Existing pydantic models must be compatible
- Integration with existing LLM service architecture

## Decision

We will implement a layered market data integration architecture with abstract data source interfaces, centralized data management, and pluggable provider implementations.

### Chosen Approach

**Market Data Service Architecture:**
```
MarketDataService (orchestrator)
├── DataSourceManager (provider management)
├── DataNormalizer (format standardization)  
├── DataValidator (quality assurance)
├── RateLimiter (API quota management)
└── DataCache (memory/disk caching)

Data Source Implementations:
├── AlphaVantageDataSource
├── YahooFinanceDataSource  
├── IEXCloudDataSource
├── PolygonDataSource
└── MockDataSource (testing)
```

**Key Components:**
1. **Abstract DataSource Interface** - Common contract for all data providers
2. **MarketDataService** - Central orchestrator managing all data operations
3. **DataSourceManager** - Factory and registry for data source instances
4. **AsyncDataFetcher** - Handles concurrent requests with backpressure
5. **DataNormalizer** - Converts provider-specific formats to standard models
6. **RateLimiter** - Per-provider rate limiting with adaptive throttling
7. **DataValidator** - Quality checks and anomaly detection
8. **DataCache** - Multi-level caching (memory + disk) for performance

### Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Direct Provider Integration**
   - Description: Directly integrate each API without abstraction layer
   - Pros: Simple implementation, fewer components
   - Cons: Tight coupling, difficult testing, no failover capability
   - Why rejected: Violates single responsibility principle, hard to maintain

2. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Description: Message queue based system with separate services
   - Pros: High scalability, loose coupling
   - Cons: Added complexity, operational overhead, latency concerns
   - Why rejected: Over-engineering for current scale requirements

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- Unified interface for all market data operations
- Easy addition of new data providers
- Robust error handling and failover capabilities
- Efficient caching reduces API costs and latency
- Comprehensive testing with mock data sources
- Rate limiting prevents API quota violations
- Data quality assurance through validation layers

### Negative Consequences

- Additional abstraction layers may introduce slight performance overhead
- More complex codebase requires thorough documentation
- Initial implementation effort is higher than direct integration
- Memory usage may increase due to caching layers

### Neutral Consequences

- Existing market data models remain compatible
- Integration follows established service patterns in codebase
- Configuration complexity increases proportionally with providers

## Implementation

### Implementation Steps

1. Create abstract DataSource interface and base classes
2. Implement MarketDataService as central orchestrator
3. Build DataSourceManager with provider registry
4. Create AsyncDataFetcher with rate limiting
5. Implement DataNormalizer for format standardization
6. Add DataValidator with quality checks
7. Build DataCache with memory and disk layers
8. Implement specific data source providers (Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, etc.)
9. Create MockDataSource for testing
10. Add comprehensive test coverage
11. Integration testing with real API providers
12. Performance optimization and monitoring

### Success Criteria

- All data providers work seamlessly with failover
- Real-time data latency under 100ms average
- Historical data backfilling completes without errors
- 99.9% uptime with graceful error handling
- API rate limits never exceeded
- Memory usage stays within acceptable bounds (configurable)
- Test coverage above 95% for all data source implementations

### Timeline

- Phase 1: Core architecture and interfaces (3-4 hours)
- Phase 2: Data source implementations (4-5 hours)  
- Phase 3: Testing and validation (2-3 hours)
- Phase 4: Performance optimization (1-2 hours)

Total estimated time: 10-14 hours

## Notes

This architecture follows the established patterns in the codebase:
- Async-first design consistent with LLM service
- Pydantic models for data validation
- Dependency injection for testability
- Configuration-driven provider selection
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

The implementation will be backward compatible with existing market data models and follow the project's code quality standards.
