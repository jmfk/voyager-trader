# ADR-0013: Skill Operations Observability Architecture

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The VOYAGER Skill Library system requires comprehensive observability to monitor skill execution performance, debug failures, track resource usage, and ensure system health. The current implementation has basic performance metrics but lacks structured monitoring, health checks, and advanced instrumentation needed for production autonomous trading operations.

### Problem Statement

How do we implement comprehensive metrics collection and observability for skill library operations while maintaining high performance and security standards?

### Key Requirements

- Real-time metrics collection for skill executions, compositions, validations
- OpenTelemetry integration for distributed tracing and metrics
- Health check endpoints for monitoring system status  
- Performance regression detection and alerting
- Security-aware logging that protects sensitive trading data
- Minimal performance impact on skill execution
- Integration with existing logging framework (Loguru)

### Constraints

- Skill execution performance must not degrade by more than 5%
- Sensitive data (API keys, trading positions) must never appear in metrics
- Must work with existing SQLite database and file-based skill storage
- Compatible with the existing skill library architecture
- Support for both development and production environments

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive observability system using OpenTelemetry for metrics and tracing, enhanced structured logging with correlation IDs, and health check endpoints, integrated seamlessly with the existing skill library components.

### Chosen Approach

**Multi-Layer Observability Architecture for Skills**:

1. **Metrics Collection Layer**:
   - OpenTelemetry metrics for counters, histograms, gauges
   - Custom skill-specific metrics (execution duration, success/failure rates)  
   - Library performance metrics (storage operations, cache performance)
   - Resource utilization tracking (memory, CPU usage per skill)

2. **Distributed Tracing**:
   - OpenTelemetry tracing for skill composition workflows
   - Span correlation across skill dependencies
   - Performance bottleneck identification in complex skill chains

3. **Enhanced Structured Logging**:
   - Correlation IDs for tracking skill execution flows
   - Sensitive data filtering and automatic masking
   - Performance event logging with structured metadata
   - Error context capture for debugging

4. **Health Monitoring**:
   - Skill library health check endpoints
   - Database connection health monitoring
   - Cache performance and memory usage tracking
   - Automated alerting for system degradation

5. **Security-Aware Observability**:
   - Automatic detection and masking of sensitive patterns
   - Configurable data retention policies
   - Audit trail for skill execution and composition events

### Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Prometheus + Grafana Native Integration**
   - Pros: Industry standard, excellent visualization, lightweight
   - Cons: Requires additional infrastructure, limited tracing capabilities
   - Why rejected: OpenTelemetry provides more comprehensive solution

2. **Custom Metrics System Only**
   - Pros: Full control, minimal dependencies, optimized for specific use case
   - Cons: Reinventing the wheel, poor ecosystem integration, maintenance overhead
   - Why rejected: OpenTelemetry provides standard approach with better tooling

3. **Application Performance Monitoring (APM) Vendor Solutions**
   - Pros: Complete solution, advanced features, professional support
   - Cons: High cost, vendor lock-in, potential security concerns with trading data
   - Why rejected: Too expensive for current scope, security concerns

## Consequences

This observability architecture will provide comprehensive insights into skill operations while introducing manageable complexity and minimal performance overhead.

### Positive Consequences

- Real-time visibility into skill execution performance and bottlenecks
- Automated detection of performance regressions and failures  
- Correlation IDs enable end-to-end tracing of complex skill compositions
- Health checks support automated monitoring and alerting
- OpenTelemetry integration provides industry-standard observability
- Security-aware logging protects sensitive trading data
- Performance impact minimized through efficient instrumentation

### Negative Consequences

- Additional complexity in skill library initialization and configuration
- Small performance overhead from metrics collection (target: <5%)
- Storage overhead for metrics and tracing data
- Learning curve for OpenTelemetry tooling and configuration

### Neutral Consequences

- Observability becomes integral part of skill development workflow
- Monitoring setup required for all deployment environments
- Additional dependencies (opentelemetry-api, opentelemetry-sdk)

## Implementation

### Implementation Steps

1. Add OpenTelemetry dependencies to requirements.txt
2. Create observability module with metrics, tracing, and logging setup
3. Instrument SkillExecutor with execution metrics and tracing
4. Add health check endpoints to SkillLibrary interface
5. Enhance existing performance tracking with structured metrics
6. Implement sensitive data filtering for logs and metrics  
7. Create monitoring dashboards and alerting configurations
8. Add comprehensive tests for observability functionality

### Key Components

```python
# src/voyager_trader/observability.py
from opentelemetry import metrics, trace
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc import metric_exporter
from loguru import logger

class SkillObservabilityManager:
    """Central observability management for skill operations."""

    def __init__(self, config: ObservabilityConfig):
        self.tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)
        self.meter = metrics.get_meter(__name__)
        self._setup_metrics()
        self._setup_logging()

    def _setup_metrics(self):
        self.execution_counter = self.meter.create_counter("skill_executions_total")
        self.execution_duration = self.meter.create_histogram("skill_execution_duration_seconds")
        self.cache_hits = self.meter.create_counter("skill_cache_hits_total")

    def instrument_execution(self, skill_id: str):
        """Context manager for instrumenting skill execution."""
        pass
```

### Success Criteria

- All skill operations generate structured metrics and logs
- Performance impact of observability is less than 5% of execution time
- Health check endpoints respond within 100ms under normal load
- Sensitive data is automatically detected and masked in all outputs
- Distributed tracing covers skill composition workflows end-to-end
- Monitoring dashboards provide real-time system health visibility
- Automated alerts trigger within 60 seconds of performance degradation

### Timeline

- OpenTelemetry integration and basic metrics: 4 days
- Enhanced structured logging with correlation IDs: 2 days  
- Health check endpoints: 2 days
- Sensitive data filtering: 2 days
- Performance optimization and testing: 3 days
- Documentation and monitoring setup: 2 days
- Total: ~2-3 weeks

## Notes

This observability architecture is designed specifically for the autonomous trading context where:
- Skills may execute thousands of times per day
- Performance degradation directly impacts trading results
- Debugging skill failures requires detailed execution context
- Security of trading data is paramount

Key design principles:
- Minimize performance impact through efficient instrumentation
- Provide actionable insights rather than just data collection
- Ensure sensitive trading data never appears in observability outputs
- Enable both automated monitoring and manual debugging workflows

The implementation will leverage existing performance tracking infrastructure in the skill library while adding comprehensive metrics collection and health monitoring capabilities.

Future enhancements may include:
- ML-based anomaly detection for skill performance patterns
- Automated skill performance optimization recommendations  
- Integration with external APM platforms (DataDog, New Relic)
- Custom alerting rules based on trading strategy performance
