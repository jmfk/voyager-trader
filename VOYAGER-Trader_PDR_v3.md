# Preliminary Design Review — "VOYAGER-Trader" (Revision 3)
*Last updated: 2025-08-06*

## 1 Purpose & Scope

Build an **autonomous, self-improving, profitable trading system** that generates sustainable profits while continuously evolving through systematic exploration. The system's primary purpose is to **generate net positive returns exceeding all operational costs** including LLM usage, infrastructure, data feeds, and transaction costs.

Following VOYAGER's paradigm of open-ended skill learning, the system will:
- Explore financial markets and discover novel trading patterns
- Build a growing library of composable trading skills
- Self-evolve its architecture, prompts, and configurations
- Maintain strict cost awareness and profitability requirements

**Execution Tiers:**
- **Intraday tier**: Sub-500ms latency for liquid instruments
- **Swing/Position tier**: <2s latency for lower-frequency strategies

**Core Principle**: Every system decision must contribute to sustainable net positive returns after deducting all operational costs.
